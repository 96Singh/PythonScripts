# PythonScripts
Python has a very easy to read and understand syntax. Its style emphasizes minimalism and clean code while allowing the developer to write in a bare-bones style that suits shell scripting. Python is an interpreted language, meaning there is no compile stage. This makes Python an ideal language for scripting.
